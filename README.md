# Decoding "Shot Marilyns" - Warhol's Color Language

Shot Marilyns Analysis

## Description

The vibrant world of Andy Warhol's Shot Marilyns reveals how color becomes a powerful language that speaks to the viewer's emotions. Our research explores how Warhol transformed a single iconic image into five distinct masterpieces. By analyzing color composition and distribution using techniques like relative conditional entropy, we uncovered intricate relationships between colors in key regions, including backgrounds, hair, eyeshadow, and face.
