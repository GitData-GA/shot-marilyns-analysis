\begin{abstract}
This study delves into the comparative analysis of five distinct
versions of Andy Warhol's ``Shot Marilyns,'' focusing on the intricacies
of their color composition and distribution. Employing a range of
analytical methods, including relative conditional entropy, this
research investigates the unique color distributions and interrelations
present in each artwork. Through the clustering of the artworks and the
meticulous examination of specified regions of interest (ROIs)---namely,
the backgrounds, hair, eyeshadow, and faces---we have unearthed profound
insights into the constructional variances and similarities among the
images. Our findings reveal that the presupposed uniformity in the
coloration of certain elements stands contradicted, thereby underscoring
the complexity and illusionary nature of color perception in visual art.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In May 2022, one of Andy Warhol's ``Shot Marilyn'' portraits set a new
auction record, selling for \$195 million, as reported by the Los
Angeles Times. This unprecedented sale has renewed both public and
scholarly interest in Warhol's work, highlighting the enduring impact of
his art on contemporary culture. The ``Shot Marilyns'' series holds
immense value, not only monetarily but also in its profound impact on
contemporary art and its reflection of societal themes. The
record-breaking auction underscores its continued relevance and
fascination (Vankin 2022). Furthermore, Marilyn Monroe remains an iconic
figure whose image has permeated popular culture. Her tragic life story,
coupled with her enduring allure, makes her an intriguing subject for
artistic exploration (Gallery 2019). Warhol's unique art style,
characterized by his use of silkscreen printing and vibrant color
schemes, offers a rich field for visual analysis. His method of
mass-producing images and manipulating colors challenges traditional
notions of art and celebrity, making the ``Shot Marilyns'' series a
perfect case study for understanding his innovative approach (Lanchner
and Warhol 2008). Through this analysis, we aim to uncover new insights
into the interplay between celebrity, media, and art, enriching our
understanding of both Warhol's work and Monroe's legacy.

In 1964, amidst the bustling atmosphere of Andy Warhol's studio, The
Factory, a significant event led to the creation of the ``Shot
Marilyns'' series. Warhol, deeply influenced by Marilyn Monroe's tragic
death in 1962, began producing silkscreen portraits of her, capturing
the iconic actress's image through repetitive, vivid depictions
(Christie's 2022). The ``Shot Marilyns'' series features five portraits
shown in Figure \ref{fig:marilyn_variations}, each rendered in different
color schemes.

The name ``Shot Marilyns'' originates from an incident involving Dorothy
Podber, a performance artist and frequent visitor to The Factory. One
day, Podber, accompanied by Warhol's friend and photographer Bill Name,
observed the Marilyn portraits lined up against a wall. She asked Warhol
for permission to ``shoot'' them, which Warhol, interpreting it as a
request to photograph the artworks, granted. Unexpectedly, Podber pulled
out a revolver and fired a shot, piercing four of the five canvases
through the forehead (Ghighi 2022). This act of violence not only
created physical damage but also added a layer of historical intrigue
and controversy to Warhol's work, further embedding it into the fabric
of pop culture and art history.

In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Andy
Warhol's ``Shot Marilyns'' series using several advanced techniques.
First, we will analyze the relative conditional entropy of the pixel
color distribution in RGB (red, green, blue) space to understand the
variations in color across the different portraits. This will provide
insights into the underlying patterns and complexity of Warhol's use of
color. Next, we will create 3D scatter plots to visualize how each pixel
color is distributed in the RGB space, enabling us to observe the
distinct color palettes used in each image. We will also apply K-means
cluster analysis to identify and compare the primary color clusters
within the portraits, highlighting different regions of interest (ROI)
such as the background, hair, eyeshadow, and face. Additionally, we will
focus on digitally repairing the ``Blue Marilyn'' using K-Nearest
Neighbors to model and analyze the RGB distribution around the
gunshot-damaged area. This restoration will involve capturing the
gunshot region and using color distribution data to reconstruct the
damaged section, preserving the artwork's integrity. Through these
methods, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of Warhol's artistic
techniques and the visual impact of his ``Shot Marilyns'' series. While
our analysis strives for objectivity, we acknowledge that
interpretations of art can be inherently subjective.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

An image is composed of pixels, each containing three color components:
Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B), denoted as (R, G, B) respectively.
These components determine the intensity of their respective colors,
with each component represented by an integer value within the range of
0 to 255 in the RGB color space. Therefore, each color component is a
discrete variable capable of assuming 256 distinct values. In the
equations below, \(Y=y\) or \(X=x\) can be selected from any of the
three color components, R, G, or B. For this study, each image in the
``Shot Marilyns'' series has a resolution of 960 by 960 pixels.

\hypertarget{entropy-calculation}{%
\subsection{Entropy Calculation}\label{entropy-calculation}}

The probability of a specific color component, \(P(Y=y)\), is determined
by dividing the number of pixels with color coordinates corresponding to
that component by the total number of color components in the entire
image. The following equations illustrate the calculation of entropy,
conditional entropy, and relative conditional entropy introduced by
Shannon (1948).

The entropy of a color component \(Y\) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  H(Y) = - \sum_{y=0}^{255} P(Y = y) \cdot \log(P(Y = y))
\end{equation}

The conditional entropy of \(Y\) given \(X\) is given by:

\begin{equation}
  H(Y|X) = \sum_{x=0}^{255} P(X = x) \cdot H(Y|X = x) = - \sum_{x=0}^{255} \sum_{y=0}^{255} P(X = x, Y = y) \log_2 \left(\frac{P(X = x, Y = y)}{P(X = x)}\right)
\end{equation}

The relative conditional entropy is calculated using the following
formula:

\begin{equation}
  HR(X|Y) = \frac{H(X|Y)}{H(X)}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{k-means-clustering-analysis}{%
\subsection{K-Means Clustering
Analysis}\label{k-means-clustering-analysis}}

In the clustering analysis, we applied K-Means clustering to examine the
color dynamics in Andy Warhol's ``Shot Marilyns'' series. For each
image, we specified 15 clusters and used the ``k-means++''
initialization method. This initialization method, introduced by Arthur
and Vassilvitskii (2007), improves the convergence speed and accuracy of
the K-Means algorithm by spreading out the initial cluster centers. This
method is particularly effective in avoiding poor clustering results due
to the random placement of initial centroids.

Mathematically, the K-Means algorithm minimizes the following objective
function:

\begin{equation}
  J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \| x - \mu_i \|^2
\end{equation}

where \(k\) is the number of clusters, \(C_i\) is the set of points
belonging to cluster \(i\), \(x\) represents a data point, and \(\mu_i\)
is the centroid of cluster \(i\). The ``k-means++'' algorithm
initializes the centroids by first selecting one random data point as
the first centroid. Subsequent centroids are chosen based on a
probability proportional to the squared distance from the nearest
existing centroid. This process can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  P(x) = \frac{D(x)^2}{\sum_{x' \in X} D(x')^2}
\end{equation}

where \(D(x)\) is the distance from the point \(x\) to the nearest
centroid already chosen.

Using this method, we applied K-Means clustering to the entire images
and specific regions of interest (ROI) in each image. The clustering
algorithm grouped pixels into clusters based on their RGB values,
effectively identifying the predominant colors in each image. This
approach allowed us to quantify and visualize the distribution of
colors, revealing the underlying color patterns and variations within
the artworks. The resulting clusters were then analyzed to understand
the prominence of specific colors across the series, as depicted in the
corresponding bar charts and ribbon visualizations. These visualizations
highlight the distinctive color schemes employed by Warhol, providing
insights into his artistic technique and color usage.

\hypertarget{roi-extraction}{%
\subsection{ROI Extraction}\label{roi-extraction}}

In our Region of Interest (ROI) analysis, we targeted segments such as
the background, hair, eye shadows, and face. We began by converting the
images to the HSV color space using OpenCV's cvtColor function, which
facilitates more effective identification and segmentation of specific
color ranges. By manually determining the minimum and maximum HSV values
within selected regions, we created color masks using OpenCV's inRange
function to isolate these target areas. These masks highlighted the
pixels that fell within the specified HSV range, effectively isolating
the desired colors from the rest of the image. Once the masks were
applied, we used OpenCV's bitwise\_and function to extract only the
parts of the image that matched the mask, discarding the rest. This
allowed us to focus on the color features of interest. The resultant
ROIs were then processed and saved for detailed analysis. This method,
enhanced by the precise capabilities of OpenCV and guided by best
practices from (Culjak et al. 2012), enabled us to highlight specific
color features in Warhol's artwork, providing nuanced insights into his
use of color and its variations, and ensuring accurate and efficient
color segmentation and analysis.

\hypertarget{k-nearest-neighbors-repair}{%
\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbors
Repair}\label{k-nearest-neighbors-repair}}

To address the damaged sections of the ``Blue Marilyn'' image, we
employed K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression for image repair. This
method involves identifying the coordinates of the damaged pixels and
using the surrounding undamaged pixels to predict their values. The KNN
regression model, with a specified number of neighbors, was trained on
the undamaged pixels' RGB values. The model then predicted the RGB
values for the damaged pixels, effectively restoring the affected area.
This approach allowed us to maintain the image's visual consistency by
leveraging the spatial color information of the undamaged regions. The
repaired images were subsequently saved and analyzed to ensure the
accuracy and aesthetic integrity of the restoration process.

Figure 4 displays the RGB space of ``Orange Marilyn'' from four
different angles. In (a), the density of pixels representing the
background part of the image is shown, revealing a balanced mix of
colors including orange, yellow, pink, red, and blue. These colors
reflect the different dominant areas of the painting: the orange
background, yellow hair, pink face, red lips, and blue eye shades. The
shape of the 3D scatter plot in (a) indicates a broad, dispersed
distribution of colors, showing the diverse color use in the background
and facial features.

In (b), the plot illustrates how colors are distributed from darker
pixels at the bottom to brighter pixels at the top, highlighting shading
gradients. This gradient reflects the shading around Marilyn's facial
features and hair, adding depth to the portrait. The darker pixels
likely represent shadows in the hair and facial contours, while the
brighter pixels correspond to highlights on her face and hair.

In (c), the concentration of the brightest pixels is evident, showing
specific groupings likely related to prominent features. This highlights
the intense colors used in Marilyn's lips, eyes, and other facial
highlights. The plot suggests a focused clustering of bright colors,
indicating areas where Warhol applied more vivid hues to draw attention.

In (d), the color distribution from dark to light is presented from a
different angle, allowing us to observe the distribution of colors in
areas such as hair and eye shades with less red. This provides a
different perspective on the artwork's color dynamics, showing how the
turquoise and yellow shades in the hair and the blue in the eyes are
distributed. The shapes in (b) through (d) all reflect a similar
elongated form, resembling a long funnel, showing a clear gradient from
dark to light colors. This consistent shape across different angles
highlights the structured way Warhol applied color to create depth and
contrast in the ``Orange Marilyn'' painting.
